Genomic and Epigenomic Signatures of PLX Drug Resistance in Melanoma Cell Lines using ATAC-Seq and RNA-Seq

Abstract:
Metastatic melanoma can develop resistance to the drug PLX, which inhibits cell growth and migration through a MITF-dependent MET signaling pathway. This study analyzes RNA- and ATAC-seq data from melanoma lines treated with a combination of PLX and shMITF to find other critical regulatory factors that permit PLX resistance through the MITF-dependent MET pathway. Furthermore, cancer immunotherapy datasets are used to find potential gene targets for patients with PLX-resistant melanoma.
