Genomic and Epigenomic Signatures of PLX Drug Resistance in Melanoma Cell Lines using ATAC-Seq and RNA-Seq

Abstract:
Melanoma can resist PLX, a small molecule drug that downregulates the MAPK pathway, through a MITF-dependent MET signaling pathway for cell growth and migration. This study uses RNA and ATAC-seq from melanoma lines treated with a combination of PLX and shMITF to find other critical regulatory factors that permit PLX resistance through the MITF-dependent MET pathway. Furthermore, immunotherapy datasets are used to find new treatments for patients with PLX-resistant melanoma.
